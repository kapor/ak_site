Matter is a service that allows professionals to send and receive quick feedback from their peers and collegues. Members are able to choose from an assortment of skills and set-up recurring feedback on a cadence of their choosing. Designing the feedback process was a fun challenge but this was one the few places where I was helping improve an existing design system, instead of owning it myself.

		After a few discussions with the engineers, we realized we needed to cover edge cases for existing Matter accounts. This is something that some team members were fine ignoring since it increased the sign-ups – even if it meant duplicates – but (obviously) decreased the user experience.
