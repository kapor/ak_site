Out of all the features that Instapaper offered, only two made sense on a wearble like Apple Watch. Between speed-reading and text-to-speech, the latter was the clear winner.

## Being among the first apps available for the iPhone when it was introduced, Instapaper has an excellent rapport with Apple. Prior to the watch being released to the public, we were among the many to be invited to design, develop and demo on prototypes on-site in Cupertino. Pretty fun trip, below is the result of those sessions.

Instapaper is a bookmarking service that allows web content to be saved so it can be "read later" on a various devices. It was founded in 2008 by Marco Arment and to Betaworks in 2013. The Instapaper team at Betaworks included myself (designer), Brian Donohue (engineer/CEO) and Rodion Gusev (everything else).
