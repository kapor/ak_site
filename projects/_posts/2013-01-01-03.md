<div class="bg_color_none">
	<div class="large_words">
	The "I'm feeling lucky" button was an attempt at automagical in 1997 but rendered useless with instant search. At the time of this project it was in real danger of being ommitted as the Google interface started to&nbsp;simplify.
	</div>
</div>

## An idea we had was to include some specific playfulness by including more "feeling" options than just Lucky (i.e. Romantic, Lost, Obscure, Heavy). We spent multiple sprints coming up with concepts that relied heavily on user data and mapping curated results.
