Advisors (aka Feedback Response Status, aka FRS, aka Recurring Feedback) was one of those never-ending projects that kept reincarnating until it’s origins were eventually lost to history. 
</div>
</div>

## Below is a series of wires to illustrate the process along with highlighted features along the way – ending with higher-fedility renderings.

{% highlight html %}
Matter is a service that allows professionals to send and receive quick feedback from their peers and collegues. Members are able to choose from an assortment of skills and set-up recurring feedback on a cadence of their choosing. Designing the feedback process was a fun challenge but this was one the few places where I was helping improve an existing design system, instead of owning it myself.

		I teamed up with a full-stack engineer and quickly put together the Feedback Response Status (FRS) page. It was a location – separate from the peers page – where a user could view a list of all the requests sent out. This was the first phase with known issues that we planned to solved in later phases:
		<div style="margin-top: 20px">
				<ul>
					<li>A user had to travel for information that could’ve easily been on the page they just departed.</li>
					<li>Categorized status and timestamps is nice but not a worthwhile enhancement to the UX.</li>
					<li>It was a whole other location (intentionally repeating the first point).</li>

What's nice about these is the potential for what they can hold, which we take advantage of in later phases.

		Recurring Feedback was added as a new feature at this point and along with it, an enhanced UX and an additional layer of complexity.

<!-- ## There was still not an easy to go back and forth between the two (FRS and Advisors) but I had a plan in place to phase that in with the engineers over the next couple sprints.
