<div class="large_words">
The idea behind the brand portal at Appreciate was very much like the name implies – giving a brand (partner) access to activity data accumulated from users wallets.

</div>

## This was very much the counterpart – backend-facing side – to Appreciate's wallet and allowed better insight on the shopper's interests and needs.

{% highlight html %}
Appreciate is/was an app/service based on the idea of putting aftermarket value on items that you buy – focusing on quality over quantity. Doing this would initially involve having a “digital twin” (NFT counterpart) of every item a customer buys.
