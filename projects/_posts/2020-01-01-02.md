<div class="large_words">
The corresponding projects – Creating a Workspace and the Member Invitee flows – marked a new approach to user onboarding at Matter. The emphasis being the team instead of the individual.

{% highlight html %}
Matter is a service that allows professionals to send and receive quick feedback from their peers and collegues. Members are able to choose from an assortment of skills and set-up recurring feedback on a cadence of their choosing. Designing the feedback process was a fun challenge but this was one the few places where I was helping improve an existing design system, instead of owning it myself.

		From a UX/UI perspective, there was basically two appropriate solutions for how to handle the design. First was to use the flow-cards that were grandfathered into the code. The second was an inline option that worked with the side navigation.

		The first option was preferred by the team mainly because it was already being used for our general sign-up flow which meant less drop-off risk – since it would be familiar to returning users – and less work for us being able to reuse code + assets.
		<div style="margin-top: 20px">
			On the other hand, I was partial to the second option for a variety of reasons. 
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="nav_subhead">
		<ul>
			 <li>The flow-card sequence sort of lives outside of the UX within the app and most users already associate it with signing-up.</li>
			 <li>The user POV was of a signed-in user – for them to click a CTA within the navigation and have them lead to a flow-card, would’ve of been confusing if not awkward.</li>
			 <li>The inline option keeps the context of the app while limiting page refreshes – which would happen with every step during a flow-card sequence.</li>
			 <li>From a usability perspective, the inline option is reassuring since it’s easier to opt out via the navigation. </li>

		In the end I was out-voted but with good reason. To be fair, when there is so many changes being made at the same time, it’s nice to take a more familiar (if not safer) direction when available.
